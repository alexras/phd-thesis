First and foremost, thanks to my parents. Throughout the past six years, being
close to home was a great source of comfort. You believed I could do this, even
when I didn't believe it myself. Thank you.

I would like to acknowledge Professor Amin Vahdat for his support as the chair
of my committee.  His support and patience throughout this process have been
invaluable.

I would also like to acknowledge George Porter, whose herculean efforts in
co-authorship, cluster management, grant writing and advising have helped
both myself and many others beyond measure.

This dissertation would not have been possible without the hard work and
support of my co-authors. Thank you all. Special thanks to Mike Conley, for
writing a ton of fantastic code and steering the ship of systems architecture
along with me.

Many thanks to my friends, both inside and outside UCSD, who have given me
their unwavering support for so many years. I am profoundly blessed to have all
of you in my life.

Chris Nyberg, Mehul Shah and Naga Govindaraju provided conscientious and
patient shepherding of TritonSort through the sort benchmark validation
process. Thanks for keeping us honest and giving us a target to hit.
