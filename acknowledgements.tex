First and foremost, thanks to my parents. Throughout the past five years, being
close to home was a great source of comfort. You believed I could do this, even
when I didn't believe it myself. Thank you.

I would like to acknowledge Professor Amin Vahdat for his support as the chair
of my committee.  His support and patience throughout this process have been
invaluable.

I would also like to acknowledge George Porter, whose herculean efforts in
co-authorship, cluster management, grant writing and advising have helped
both myself and many others beyond measure.

This dissertation would not have been possible without the hard work and
support of my co-authors. Thank you all.

Many thanks to my friends, both inside and outside UCSD, who gave me their
unwavering support (and, in some cases, the use of their couch). I am
profoundly blessed to have all of you in my life.
