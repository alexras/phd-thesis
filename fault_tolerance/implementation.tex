\section{Implementation}

In this section, we describe the implementation of our fault tolerance
strategies as an extension to \themis. Section~\ref{sec:themis} provides a
brief overview of \themis' architecture, and Section~\ref{sec:recovery}
describes the implementation of our write and read recovery strategies in the
context of that architecture. In Section~\ref{sec:multi-tenancy}, we describe
extensions to \themis to support multi-tenancy. Section~\ref{sec:control_plane}
describes the way that jobs are dispatched.
Section~\ref{sec:input_file_gathering} describes how files are assigned to
nodes, and explores the practical concern of achieving high bandwidth from
distributed storage. Section~\ref{sec:fault_response} describes how failures
are detected and how nodes respond to failure during a job.
