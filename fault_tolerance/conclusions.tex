\section{Conclusions}

MapReduce's traditional approach to fault tolerance is proportional, but it
imposes the overhead of additional rounds of I/O in common-case operation,
which negatively impacts the system's overall performance. In this work, we
have shown that, through leveraging the multi-tenancy typical of a MapReduce
cluster and composing previously-known fault tolerance techniques, it is
possible to provide proportional fault tolerance without imposing additional
rounds of I/O in failure-free operation.
