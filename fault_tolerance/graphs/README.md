## `scan_vs_seek.pdf`

Generated by running `./plot_scan_vs_seek.py /mnt/tritonsort/usenix13_experiments/scan_or_seek_benchmark_results/`

## `simultaneous_*_different_files.pdf`

mv simultaneous_scan.pdf simultaneous_scan_different_files.pdf
mv simultaneous_seek.pdf simultaneous_seek_different_files.pdf

## `hdfs_no_proxy_penalty.pdf`

How the file "times.txt", which is used as input to
`plot_hdfs_no_proxy_penalty.py` to generate `hdfs_no_proxy_penalty.pdf`, was
derived:

Run `calculate_rate.py` on each subdirectory of
`/mnt/tritonsort/usenix13_experiments/hdfs_no_proxy_penalty`.

You can do this as follows:

```bash
for batch in `ls -d batch*`
do
    ~/src/themis.git/src/scripts/themis/metaprograms/calculate_rate/calculate_rate.py ${batch}
done
```

Rename files
appropriately so that you have `no_proxy_trial_{123}.txt`,
`proxy_trial_{123}.txt` and `raw_disk_trial_{123}.txt`. You can do this as
follows (assuming that you've got symlinks between named directories and their
batch numbers:

```bash
ls -lt | grep -E '^l' | awk '{print "mv",$9 ".txt", $11 ".txt"}' | xargs -I{} bash -c {}
```

Run `extract_times_from_calculate_rate_files.sh`; this will produce times.txt,
which you can then feed into `plot_hdfs_no_proxy_penalty.py`

## `disk_recovery_proportionality.pdf`

Same thing as with the above, but run it on `/mnt/tritonsort/usenix13_experiments/disk_recovery_proportionality` and run it through `plot_disk_recovery_proportionality.py`.
