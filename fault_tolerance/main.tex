\chapter{I/O-Efficient Fault Tolerance}
\label{chapter:fault_tolerance}

A key requirement when building scale-out data processing architectures is
allowing them to recover from failures in a manner that is transparent to the
end user. Traditional MapReduce implementations provide fault tolerance by
materializing intermediate data to disk on both sides of a network
transfer. This increases the amount of disk I/O that each MapReduce job must
perform, which fundamentally limits the performance of I/O-bound workloads.

In this chapter, we argue that small and medium clusters -- on which MapReduce
is commonly deployed, and where the likelihood of a failure during a job is low
relative to large-scale clusters -- can benefit from more optimistic forms of
fault tolerance for which the common-case overhead is far lower than
traditional approaches. In particular, we explore the implications of the
job-level fault tolerance approach adopted by Themis in the previous chapter,
and describe an alternative fault tolerance method for Themis that leverages
prior work in scan sharing and eager record-level provenance.
