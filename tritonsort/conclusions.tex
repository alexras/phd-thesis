\section{Conclusions}
\label{tritonsort:sec:conclusions}

In this work, we describe the hardware and software architecture necessary to
build \tritonsort, a highly efficient, pipelined, stage-driven sorting system
designed to sort tens to hundreds of TB of data.  Through careful management of
system resources to ensure cross-resource balance, we are able to sort tens of
GB of data per node per minute, resulting in \tsrate GB/min across only
\tsnodes nodes.  We believe the work holds a number of lessons for balanced
system design and for scale-out architectures in general and will help inform
the construction of more balanced data processing systems that will bridge the
gap between scalability and per-node efficiency.
