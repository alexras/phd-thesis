There is a growing need for scalable, data-intensive processing platforms to
analyze and filter the large volume of data collected by both corporations and
scientific institutions. The effectiveness of these systems is measured by the
quantity and quality of data that they can process in a reasonable amount of
time; thus, these systems have very high I/O and storage requirements.

Existing systems are very effective at scaling to large cluster
sizes. Unfortunately, there exists a significant gap between the performance
these systems provide and the underlying capacity of the hardware
infrastructure on which they are deployed.

In this dissertation, I endeavor to bridge this performance gap by focusing on
efficient I/O as a first-class architectural concern. In particular, I present
two systems, TritonSort and Themis. TritonSort is a high-performance
large-scale sorting system capable of sorting 100TB of data on a modestly-sized
cluster at about 82\% of that cluster's peak hardware performance. Themis is a
successor system to TritonSort that supports the popular MapReduce programming
paradigm and can run a wide spectrum of MapReduce jobs at nearly the speed at
which TritonSort can sort. I conclude with the implementation of a fault
tolerance scheme for Themis that provides proportional fault tolerance without
imposing additional rounds of I/O during common-case operation.
