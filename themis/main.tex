\chapter{Themis: I/O-Efficient MapReduce}
\label{chapter:themis}

This chapter presents Themis\footnote{Themis is a Titan in Greek mythology who
  is tasked with creating balance, order and harmony.}, an I/O-efficient
MapReduce system derived from TritonSort.

Many MapReduce jobs are I/O-bound, and so minimizing the number of I/O
operations is critical to improving their performance. Themis reads and writes
data records to disk exactly twice, which is the minimum amount possible for
data sets that cannot fit in memory.

In order to minimize I/O, Themis makes fundamentally different design decisions
from previous MapReduce implementations. Themis performs a wide variety of
MapReduce jobs -- including click log analysis, DNA read sequence alignment,
and PageRank -- at nearly the speed of TritonSort's record-setting sort
performance.
